DbFramework TODO list

- Moved the test tables creation from Makefile.PL/Build.PL to the
  test suite, and clean up the test tables after the test suite
  finished.
- Remove the Makefile.PL/Build.PL dependency to DbFramework::Util,
  and hence Term::ReadKey.  It does not make sense that
  Makefile.PL/Build.PL fails to run.  CPAN and CPANPLUS shells
  cannot install with this, too.
- Rename t/util.pl to t/util.pm, and remove Makefile.PL/Build.PL
  dependency to it, too.
- Dealing with the installation of forms/dbforms.cgi.
- Seperate INSTALL from README.
- Register a proper name space and drop the unused.
- Transfer the primary maintainer of DbFramework::CandidateKey,
  DbFramework::Catalog, DbFramework::DataModelObject,
  DbFramework::DataType::ANSII, DbFramework::DataType::Mysql,
  DbFramework::DefinitionObject, DbFramework::Relationship and
  DbFramework::Template to me.
- Remove "UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE" from search.cpan.org.
- Maybe make DbFramework working again.
- Retire DbFramework.
